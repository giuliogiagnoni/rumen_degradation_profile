# rumen_degradation_profile
Shiny app to model rumen degradation profile of feedstuffs

Can be used from shinyapps:

https://gigiapps.shinyapps.io/Rumen_Degradation/

Or directly in R/RStudio, with the following code:

library(shiny)  
runGitHub( "rumen_degradation_profile", "giuliogiagnoni")

In this case make sure all required packages are installed in your machine.

If there is interest I might record some sort of tutorial.
